## 1.0.1 - 2018-12-20

BUGFIX: Shutdown express server after build (thanks @astronomersiva)
BUGFIX: Add protocol to fastboot requests for improved compatibility (thanks @xg-wang)

## 1.0.0 - 2018-10-28

BREAKING: We now require ember-cli-fastboot >= 2.0.0, and if you're using broccoli-asset-rev it should be >= 2.7.0. This is to fix the order in which these run relative to prember, so that all asset links will get correct handling.

## 0.4.0 - 2018-04-25

BREAKING: the signature for custom url discovery functions has changed from

    async function(distDir, visit) { return [...someURLs] }

to

    async function({ distDir, visit }) { return [...someURLs] }

This makes it nicer to compose multiple URL discovery strategies.
